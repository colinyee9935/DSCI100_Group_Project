    "Our data set takes many colleges, and groups them according to where they’re located by region. Along with the region, our data set has the starting median salary, along with the mid-career median salary which further aids classification. \n",

    "The data set we are using from Where it pays to attend college is “Salaries for colleges by region”, collected from The Wall Street Journal, Payscale Inc. This data frame provides the average entry level salary and mid-career salary from colleges in the U.S., which are classified by the regions the colleges are located in. We intend to use K-nearest neighbors classification to examine the data set, whereby we predict new observations (colleges that are not within our data sets) into a region based on their entry and mid-career salary using K numbers of closest entry and mid-career salary in the set.\r\n",

    "## METHODS\n",
    "\n",
    "The three columns of data we will be using from the data set are region, starting median salary, mid-career salary. Region is going to be our factor in the analysis, and starting median salary, and mid career salary are going to be our predictors. The significance of starting median salary and mid career salary is the combination gives a more holistic view of alumni’s salary as people who graduated from the top colleges are likely to receive higher average salary at the start but for those who did not go to those colleges, they might start with lower average salary but eventually hit that bar. This creates a unique pattern of identification for the type of colleges, which is also impacted by the regions of the colleges (higher paying places vs. lower paying places) a person went to when performing the classification, allowing for higher accuracy during the test. As stated above, we will create a K-nearest neighbors classification model with the region as factor and the two salary types as the predictors. Before this, we’ll follow the conventions of subsetting our data set into 5 proportionate subset, each will be tested against the remaining 80% of the data for training of internal consistency, and yield the best possible K. We’ll then use this K value for classification of a newly observed data set provided in another sheet from the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "We’ll be generating a confusion matrix that helps to visualize the number of correct predictions and false predictions. From here, we’re going to be able to assess the accuracy of the model in terms of its accuracy, precision, and recall by defining the positive object.\n"
